Step-1: Start
Step-2: Define function for input of values, into a given multi-dimensional array "matrix", with a variable "li".
Step-3: Repeat processes 4 to 5, until integer variable "k" with value 0, becomes less than 'li'.
Step-4: Repeat process 5, until integer variable "l" with value 0, becomes less than 'li'.
Step-5: Scan the value for the location of the individualplaces of the array, where positions equal to the value of k as rows, and the value of l as columns.
Step-6: End function
Step-7: Define function for output of values, into a given multi-dimensional array "matrix", with a variable "li".

Step-12: Define main function
Step-13: Define integer variables - opt, lim, i, j, and integer arrays - matA, matB, sum, diff, mul, tra.
Step-14: Repeat process 15 to 44, until the loop is broken with a choice.
Step-15: Ask for options which does the corresponding function to them.
Step-16: If selection equals 1, execute processes 17 to 23, else skip to next process.

Step-25: Enter the value for the variable lim, as the limit of the array.
Step-26: Input values for the first and second arrays, matA and matB, using the input function.
Step-27: Display both of the arrays.
Step-28: Repeat processes 29 to 30, until value of variable i = 0, less than lim.
Step-29: Repeat processes 30, until value of variable j = 0, less than lim.
Step-30: Value of a position of array diff(i,j), is the difference of the corresponding values at arrays, matA and matB.
Step-31: Print the values of the array diff, using the output function.
Step-32: If selection equals 3, execute processes 33 to 41, else skip to next process.
Step-33: Enter the value for the variable lim, as the limit of the array.
Step-34: Input values for the first and second arrays, matA and matB, using the input function.

Step-36: Repeat processes 27 to 39, until value of variable i = 0, less than lim.
Step-37: Repeat processes 38 to 39, until value of variable j = 0, less than lim.
Step-38: Repeat process 39, until value of variable k = 0, less than lim.
Step-39: Set value of mul(i,j) = 0.
Step-40: Value of a position of array mul(i,j), is the sum of the corresponding values at mul(i,j), and the product of matA(i,k) and matB(k,j).
Step-41: Print the values of the array mul, using the output function.
Step-42: If selection equals 4, execute processes 43 to 49, else skip to next process.
Step-43: Enter the value for the variable lim, as the limit of the array.
Step-44: Input values for the array matA, using the input function.
Step-45: Display the array.
Step-46: Repeat processes 47 to 48, until value of variable i = 0, less than lim.
Step-47: Repeat processes 48, until value of variable j = 0, less than lim.
Step-48: Value of a position of array tra(i,j), is value of at the position of array matA(j,i).
Step-49: Print the values of the array tra, using the output function.
Step-50: If selection equal 5, execute process 51, else skip to next process.
Step-51: Break the loop.
Step-52: If selection be anything else, show default message.
Step-53: Stop
